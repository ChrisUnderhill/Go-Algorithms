This was a project over the Summer of Year 12 and some of Year 13 to make a
platform for testing Go-playing algorithms against each other.

Prerequisites: must have VPython installed. 

Can be run from Tournament Handling 5.py
Once a game starts the screen on the left will display the current board state.
If one of the players is chosen to be a human, they can click on locations on
the board to place pieces there. Clicking in any invalid space will send "pass"
instead, so to deliberately pass you can click on the black space outside the
board region.

Scoring does not yet accurately assess who controls areas if the areas are not
entirely surrounded.
